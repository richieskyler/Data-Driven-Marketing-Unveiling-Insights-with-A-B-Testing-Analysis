## A/B Testing Project: Marketing Campaign Optimization

## Project Overview

This A/B testing project aims to optimize marketing campaigns by deciding between two labels: Control Campaign and Test Campaign. The objective is to choose the campaign that best aligns with the business goals.

## Metrics Used in Analysis

### 1. Click Through Rate (CTR)

- Definition: Percentage of target customers clicking on a link or CTA.
- Formula: CTR = (Number of Website Clicks / Number of Impressions) x 100
- Interpretation: Higher CTR indicates better engagement.

### 2. Cost Per Click (CPC)

- Definition: Price paid for each website click in marketing campaign ads.
- Formula: CPC = (Amount Spend / Number of Website Clicks)
- Interpretation: Lower CPC is favorable for reaching the target audience.

### 3. Conversion Rate

- Definition: Percentage of visiting customers becoming actual customers.
- Formula: Conversion Rate = (No. of Purchases / No. of Website Clicks) x 100
- Interpretation: Higher conversion rate signifies a successful campaign.

### 4. Cost Per Conversion

- Definition: Average amount paid for each customer in marketing campaign ads.
- Formula: Cost per Conversion = (Amount Spend / Number of Purchases)
- Interpretation: Lower cost per conversion is desirable.

### 5. Added to Cart Rate (ACR)

- Definition: Percentage of visiting customers adding a product to their cart.
- Formula: ACR = (No. of Items added to cart / No. of Website Clicks) x 100
- Interpretation: Higher ACR suggests appealing products.

### 6. Cost Per Impression (CPM)

- Definition: Amount paid for 1000 impressions in marketing campaign ads.
- Formula: CPM = (Amount Spend / No. of Impressions) x 1000
- Interpretation: Lower CPM is preferable.
